# Face Detection Desktop Application (Java)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Java-based desktop application** that detects human faces in images.  
The application allows users to load photos from their computer and automatically identifies faces using computer vision techniques.

It is designed as a **simple, user-friendly desktop tool** for learning and demonstrating face detection concepts.

## 🖼️ Features
- Load images from local storage
- Detect human faces in photos
- Draw bounding boxes around detected faces
- Display processed images in a desktop UI
- Fast and accurate face detection
- Easy-to-use graphical interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Java Swing / JavaFX** (for desktop UI)
- **OpenCV** (for face detection)
- **Haar Cascade Classifier**

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User selects an image from the system.
2. The image is converted to grayscale.
3. A pre-trained Haar Cascade model is used to detect faces.
4. Rectangles are drawn around detected faces.
5. The final image is displayed on the screen.
